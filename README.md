# Cinema Box

This project is a comprehensive web application for booking cinema tickets. It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0 and uses Angular's Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO capabilities. The application also uses a state management solution to manage and share state across components. The user interface is built using the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework for a responsive and modern design. All data for the project is stored in temporary JSON files.

## Technologies

- **JSON:** Lightweight data-interchange format for storing and transporting data.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
To serve the project with Server-Side Rendering, run `npm run serve:ssr`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. For a production build with Server-Side Rendering, run `npm run build:ssr`.

## Running unit tests
